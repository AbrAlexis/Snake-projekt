In pixels green, on a grid so tight,
A serpent glides, in the soft moonlight.
A hungry spirit, on a quest to dine,
In the realm of squares, where paths entwine.

Through the corridors of the digital plane,
The snake slithers, its hunger to sustain.
A dance of keys, a player's embrace,
Guiding the serpent with every trace.

Eyes aglow with the glow of the screen,
A pixelated hunger, fierce and keen.
In the binary jungle, where it roams,
The snake, a poet in pixel poems.

With every apple, a victory cheer,
A triumph sung, loud and clear.
But beware the tail, a perilous waltz,
In the digital realm where hunger exalts.

In the code's embrace, a creature's ballet,
The snake, a dancer in the game's array.
A pixelated sonnet, in bytes and bits,
A slithering ballad, where the grid submits.
